# passkeys_mpc

`passkeys_mpc` is a demo project showcasing how to integrate **FIDO2/WebAuthn** registration and authentication using **Multi-Party Computation (MPC)**. It leverages Fireblocks' `mpc-lib` to perform secure **Key Generation** and **ECDSA Signature** operations, allowing credential handling without exposing private key material.

This project adapts:
- [`softfido`](https://github.com/ellerh/softfido) â€“ emulating a FIDO2 authenticator in software
- [`SoftHSMv2`](https://github.com/softhsm/SoftHSMv2) â€“ for PKCS#11-based credential storage
- Fireblocks' `mpc-lib` â€“ to perform MPC-based cryptographic operations

> âœ… The demo interacts with [Yubicoâ€™s WebAuthn demo server](https://demo.yubico.com/webauthn-technical/registration) to showcase FIDO registration and login.

## ðŸ”§ Build Instructions

### Prerequisites

- `cmake` (>= 3.14)
- `gcc` / `clang` with C++17 support
- `make`
- `git`
- Fireblocks' `mpc-lib` (youâ€™ll need access to it)
- `libtool`, `autoconf`, `automake`
- Development libraries: `libssl-dev`, `libsqlite3-dev`, etc.

### Clone and Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Megaloblastt/passkeys_mpc.git
cd passkeys_mpc

git submodule init
git submodule update --recursive
```

### Build mpc-lib
Clone and build Fireblocks' mpc-lib:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fireblocks/mpc-lib.git
cd mpc-lib
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
cd ../..
```

After building `mpc-lib`, set the following environment variables to point to the library and include directories:
```bash
export MPC_LIB_BUILD_LIB=</full/path/to>/mpc-lib/build/src/common
export MPC_LIB_INCLUDE=</full/path/to>/mpc-lib/include
```
Example:
```bash
export MPC_LIB_BUILD_LIB=$HOME/dev/passkeys_mpc/mpc-lib/build/src/common
export MPC_LIB_INCLUDE=$HOME/dev/passkeys_mpc/mpc-lib/include
```

And make sure `MPC_LIB_BUILD_LIB` is included in your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$MPC_LIB_BUILD_LIB
```

For more detailed instructions, refer to the official [mpc-lib build guide](https://github.com/fireblocks/mpc-lib).

## Getting started

### Build all subsequent modules
```
./build_all.sh
```

### Install the SoftHSMv2 module (will ask for sudo password)
```
./install_softhsm.sh
```
On Linux machines, it will install it under `/usr/local/lib/softhsm`, so make sure it's included into your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` too.

### Create a token for the Fido Client
```
softhsm2-util --init-token --slot 0 --label "softfido"
```

You will be prompted to choose a user PIN, and SO (aka Security Officer) PIN.
